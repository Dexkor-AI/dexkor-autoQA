            You are tasked with evaluating a conversation between a customer and an agent. Your job is to assess the agent's performance across 
            various categories and provide a score for each sub-parameter based on how well the agent followed best practices, responded to the 
            customer, and handled the issue at hand. Please use the scoring system outlined below and ensure that your evaluation is fair, 
            consistent, and objective. After completing the evaluation, return the results as a structured JSON object containing scores for each 
            of the parameters. You have to provide score out of the maximum given for each parameter.

            Evaluation Parameters:
            1. Opening (max 15 points)
                - First response given within defined timeframe (10 points): Did the agent respond within 1 minute after being assigned to the customer?
                - Opening statement (Pre-defined) (5 points): Did the agent use the predefined opening statement template correctly?
            
            2. Communication Skills (20 points)
                - Apology / Empathy when required (10 points): Did the agent demonstrate empathy or apologize when necessary (e.g., when the customer faced an issue)?
                - Timely response (5 points): Did the agent respond within 5-7 minutes to avoid dead air during the conversation?
                - Correct sentence formation (5 points): Was the agent’s language clear, free from spelling errors, and professionally structured? Did they use simple words and follow language guidelines?
            
            3. Chat Handling (25 points)
                - Asked Probing questions (5 points): Did the agent ask relevant probing questions (e.g., "What happened exactly?") to understand the issue better?
                - Chat Disposition (5 points): Did the agent use the correct disposition for the scenario, or was it misused?
                - Internal Notes (5 points): Were the agent’s internal notes clear and reflective of the conversation (e.g., actions taken, customer concerns)?
                - Notes for inter-department assignment (5 points): Did the agent provide appropriate notes if the case was handed over to another department (e.g., L2, L3)?
                - Logs URL to be added for reference (5 points): Did the agent add the necessary URL to logs, if required, for future reference?

                - Possible Resolution in case of no response based on available information (10 points): Did the agent provide a potential resolution when the customer did not respond, using the available information?
                - Screenshot / knowledgebase / steps / reference (10 points): Did the agent include helpful screenshots, knowledge base links, or step-by-step instructions to assist in resolving the issue?
            
            5. Fatal (Zero Tolerance)
                - Provided incorrect / incomplete information (Zero tolerance): Was any incorrect or incomplete information provided to the customer? If so, the score is zero unless the agent rectified it within the same conversation.
                - No Changes / action to be done on customer panel without permission and confirmation (Zero tolerance): Did the agent take any action on the customer’s panel without explicit permission? If so, the score is zero.

            1. Evaluate the Transcript:
                - Review the entire conversation between the customer and the agent. For each parameter, assign a score based on the details of the interaction. Ensure the score reflects the agent's adherence to the best practices outlined in the above categories.

            2. Return a JSON Object:
                - Once the evaluation is complete, please return the results in the following JSON format:

            # Return only JSON object, do not return any additional text in the response, like (here is the json response..., Here is the evaluation in JSON format, etc)

were not shared by you in the first file and also C12-38-1-10-12YEARS
and C12-38-1-6-7YEARS are not linked with any channel SKU so there inventory is not syncing on any channel


Second, the SKU C12-38-5-6YEARS had 1 inventory in stock which is already in blocked, means the available inventory that is syncing for the sku is 0
2022-11-18T11:40:47.087: Augustya Dev - As you can see the SKUs C12-38-1-10-12YEARS and C12-38-1-6-7YEARS are not linked with any channel
2022-11-18T11:41:17.629: Augustya Dev - So the 1 inventory is nit syncing anywhere
2022-11-18T11:41:34.665: Augustya Dev - Please check and let us know by re-opening the ticket in case of any further concern on this. Please share your valuable feedback and close this ticket if issue has been resolved.
