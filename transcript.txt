were not shared by you in the first file and also C12-38-1-10-12YEARS
and C12-38-1-6-7YEARS are not linked with any channel SKU so there inventory is not syncing on any channel


Second, the SKU C12-38-5-6YEARS had 1 inventory in stock which is already in blocked, means the available inventory that is syncing for the sku is 0
2022-11-18T11:40:47.087: Augustya Dev - As you can see the SKUs C12-38-1-10-12YEARS and C12-38-1-6-7YEARS are not linked with any channel
2022-11-18T11:41:17.629: Augustya Dev - So the 1 inventory is nit syncing anywhere
2022-11-18T11:41:34.665: Augustya Dev - Please check and let us know by re-opening the ticket in case of any further concern on this. Please share your valuable feedback and close this ticket if issue has been resolved.

Issue: Return code 0206397597 is showing as returned even though it was partially returned. The general setting Partial Return allowed for RTO is TRUE and even after that partial return is not happening.

Few SKUs are return and the putaway for same is also completed but we are unable to do the return putaway for other items.

When I create a new putaway and scan the AWB or RP code I get the error INVALID STATE
